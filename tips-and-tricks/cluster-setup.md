# Cluster Setup

## What is clustering?

Generally speaking, clustering is a way to link multiple containers and / or servers for a certain job in the setup. The purpose is usually to increase the availability and / or performance of the setup and has amongst other things the following benefits:

* you can introduce redundancy for any single component \(e.g. cache, appserver or database\). Even if a component fails, the shop will still work, as there is no "single point of failure"
* the load \(i.e. the users\) can be distributed across the cluster. So there is not a single appserver that will need to handle all users - but all users are distributed across all available appservers.
* scaling the setup becomes easier: As any component is layed out in a redundant manner, you can easily add another varnish server or appserver on the fly once your shop is confronted with more traffic \(e.g. after an TV advertisement\).

## In which folders does Shopware write?

By default Shopware writes in following folders:

| Path | Description | Can be saved in external Storage by default |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| custom/plugins | Plugins from Plugin Manager | No |
| config/jwt | JWT Certificate | No |
| files | Documents and other private files | Yes |
| var/log | Logs | No |
| var/cache | Cache \(**DON'T SHARE IT**\) | No |
| public/theme | Compiled theme files | Yes |
| public/media | Media | Yes |
| public/bundles | Plugin Assets | Yes |
| public/sitemap | Sitemap | Yes |
| public/thumbnail | Media Thumbnails | Yes |
|  |  |  |

## The example traditional setup

* Load Balancer \(LB\)
  * It will handle all requests and forward it to the app servers
* App Servers
  * Runs Shopware 6
  * Runs worker for the queue
* Admin Server
  * Handles the administration \(/admin\)
  * Deployment
  * Jumphost
* Redis Cluster
  * Sharing sessions
  * Sharing application cache
  * Sharing http cache
* MySQL Cluster
  * Persistent storage for store related data

## The example container setup

* Load Balancer \(LB\)
  * It will handle all requests and forward it to the app containers
* App Container\(s\)
  * Runs Shopware 6
* Worker Container\(s\)
  * Handles tasks from Queue
* Scheduled Task Container
  * Triggers Scheduled Task to the Queue
* MySQL Container\(s\)
* Redis Container\(s\)

## App Server / Container

To get them in sync you should consider using an external storage like S3, GCP etc. [See this page for an example configuration](). The logs should be aggregated to one place using an tool like FileBeat, Datadog etc. Choose your favorite.

The JWT Certificate is static, this needs to be only shared once.

### Example Storage Configuration

{% code title="config/packages/storage.yaml" %}
```yaml
shopware:
    filesystem:
        private:
            type: "amazon-s3"
            config:
                bucket: "documents"
                endpoint: "http://minio:9000"
                use_path_style_endpoint: true
                region: 'local'
                credentials:
                    key: AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE
                    secret: wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY
                options:
                    visibility: "private"
        public:
            type: "amazon-s3"
            url: 'http://s3.localhost/media'
            config:
                bucket: "media"
                endpoint: "http://minio:9000"
                use_path_style_endpoint: true
                region: 'local'
                credentials:
                    key: AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE
                    secret: wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY
                options:
                    visibility: "public"
        theme:
            type: "amazon-s3"
            url: 'http://s3.localhost/theme'
            config:
                bucket: "theme"
                endpoint: "http://minio:9000"
                use_path_style_endpoint: true
                region: 'local'
                credentials:
                    key: AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE
                    secret: wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY
                options:
                    visibility: "public"
        asset:
            type: "amazon-s3"
            url: 'http://s3.localhost/asset'
            config:
                bucket: "asset"
                endpoint: "http://minio:9000"
                use_path_style_endpoint: true
                region: 'local'
                credentials:
                    key: AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE
                    secret: wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY
                options:
                    visibility: "public"
        sitemap:
            type: "amazon-s3"
            url: 'http://s3.localhost/sitemap'
            config:
                bucket: "sitemap"
                endpoint: "http://minio:9000"
                use_path_style_endpoint: true
                region: 'local'
                credentials:
                    key: AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE
                    secret: wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY
                options:
                    visibility: "public"
```
{% endcode %}

### Example Cache Configuration

This config assumes you have the env variables "REDIS\_CACHE\_HOST", "REDIS\_CACHE\_PORT" and "REDIS\_CACHE\_DATABASE"

{% code title="config/packages/redis.yaml" %}
```yaml
framework:
    cache:
        app: cache.adapter.redis
        system: cache.adapter.redis
        pools:
            serializer:
                adapter: cache.adapter.redis
            annotations:
                adapter: cache.adapter.redis
            property_info:
                adapter: cache.adapter.redis
            messenger:
                adapter: cache.adapter.redis
            property_access:
                adapter: cache.adapter.redis
        default_redis_provider: "redis://%env(REDIS_CACHE_HOST)%:%env(REDIS_CACHE_PORT)%/%env(REDIS_CACHE_DATABASE)%"
```
{% endcode %}

### Example Session Configuration

You will need first to install the Redis PHP Extension.

{% code title="php.ini" %}
```text
session.save_handler = redis
session.save_path = "tcp://REDIS_HOST:REDIS_PORT?database=DB"
```
{% endcode %}

## Plugins

Plugins should be in the repository or required with Composer using [packages](https://packages.friendsofshopware.com). The admin user should not use the plugin manager to update plugins.

## Known issues

* Workers are still running with old code.
  * The workers can be stopped with the command \`\`bin/console messenger:stop-workers\`\` before/after rolling out the new code.
* Shopware does not work when its mounted as read only filesystem
* When Plugins are not using the correct asset package, urls with result in 404 when external storage is configured
  * Contact the plugin manufacturer to correct the asset usage
* Request IP is wrong or requests are made with HTTP
  * You need to configure [TRUSTED\_PROXIES](https://symfony.com/doc/current/deployment/proxies.html)
* The Shopware Core does not support Primary / Replica for MySQL by default
